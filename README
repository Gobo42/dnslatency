dns latency calculator from tcpdump
(matt.hum@hpe.com)

dump locally
tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53 | ./dnslatency

suppress anything < 10 ms
tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53 | ./dnslatency -ms | grep -v -P " \dms"

to send to syslog add wrapper and send
tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53 | ./dnslatency | sed "s/^/<14>$(hostname -i) /" | nc -u <sysloghost> 514

Can also capture tcpdump output and pipe it into the calculator
tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53 > mycapture
cat mycapture | ./dnslatency

Alert when more than 150 outstanding DNS requests to any given server. 
tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53 | ./dnslatency --rep 150

Show DNS server IPs instead of hostname
tcpdump -ni ens192 udp port 53 | ./dnslatency -v


Optional command line vars
-D          Print Debug messages
-DD         Extra debug
-c          Add color to Debug to make it easier to read
-ms         Suppress all requests < 1 ms
-v          Shows destination dns server in output
-rep <val>  Tracks DNS server reputation (outstanding requests). Requires threshold value
            Note: Be aware that at some point all servers will reach this threshold, it depends on time. Does not track rate.

Windows executable was tested with this version of tcpdump for windows (https://chiselapp.com/user/rkeene/repository/tcpdump-windows-wrapper/home). Windump did not work.

May need to wait a bit for the first input to come in. We need to see a request and a matching response before we can output anything. If there is no output after 30 sec, capture tcpdump output to a text file and create a github issue.
